Permissions and Security Redux
==============================

Now that we have cool permission checks, how about we add them to the controller too!

This makes our controllers much more complicated!

How can we manage this complexity?

* Idea: Extract permissions to its own object for easier tests!

We have just complicated our controller tests.

* Member vs. Nonmember
* Member with post vs. Member without post
* Logged in vs. Anonymous user

Exercises
---------

* Create `PermissionsHelper#can_create_post?`
* Create `PermissionsHelper#can_edit_post?`
* Create `PermissionsHelper#can_create_comment?`
* Call `can_create_post?` in `posts/index.html.erb`
* Call `can_edit_post?` in `posts/show.html.erb`
* Call `can_create_comment?` in `posts/show.html.erb`
* Write separate PostsController tests for the following conditions:
    * Member (no post for the day)
    * Owner (member with a post for the day)
    * Nonmember
    * Anonymous
* Cover the following cases:
    * Owner can edit and update
    * Member/Nonmember/Anonymous can't edit or update
