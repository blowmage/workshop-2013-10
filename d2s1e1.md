Permissions and Security
========================

We have a working app! Except it doesn't work all the time...

Let's turn on our Critical QA mind!

* Missing Business Logic: `Group#empty_post` `Group#empty_coment(post)`
* Demo "New Post" issues
* Demo "Edit Post" issues
* Demo "New Comment" issues

Questions
---------

* Is it the Inner Application's job to enforce who can post or edit? (Admin?)
* Can a User with Administrator privileges edit on this UI? Or through an Admin UI?

ActionView::TestCase
--------------------

* Just the thing to test helpers!

* `assert_template`
* `assert_tag`
* `assert_no_tag`
* `assert_select`
* `assert_select_encoded`
* `assert_select_email`
* `assert_recognizes`
* `assert_generates`
* `assert_routing`
* `assert_response`
* `assert_redirected_to`
* `assert_dom_equal`
* `assert_dom_not_equal`

Exercises
---------

* Only Group members can create posts (Should Domain enforce this?)
* Only Group members should see "New Post" link (UI)
* Only Post Owner can see "Edit Post link" (UI)
* Only logged in users should see "New Comment"


* Create `PermissionsHelper#can_create_post?`
* Create `PermissionsHelper#can_view_post?`
* Create `PermissionsHelper#can_edit_post?`
* Create `PermissionsHelper#can_create_comment?`
